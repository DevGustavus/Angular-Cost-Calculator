## üìñ About the project
This project aimed to improve my skills with Angular, serving as a self-directed educational endeavor. Through it, I could delve deeper into the concepts of full-stack development and learn how to consume APIs using Angular.

The project revolves around a cost calculator, allowing users to input data for calculation and organization, including:
- Name
- Description
- Value

The database is a simple JSON file, and it is served by JSON Server, functioning as the backend.
